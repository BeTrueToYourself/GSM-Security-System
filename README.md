# GSM-Security-System
Now a days we are upgrading our life day by day using modern technologies. But where the topic “technology” arises, we have to talk about a lot of electronic devices that we have got by the blessings of science. We are using these technologies for several purposes. This project is also an implementation of modern technology. We have designed and developed an arduino based smart security system, using alarm and SMS based security. The Arduino Based security is the initial and GSM is the secondary security we have implemented. GSM will confirm you by sending a SMS that, security is interrupted. Here we have used a photo sensor to detect the laser light and used 5V relay to turn on the camera to capture the interrupter and used SIM 808 GSM device for SMS confirmation. Here by reflecting the laser light with mirror, a particular space has been secured by laser, A program has been developed and burnt into the microcontroller of the Arduino module. This system is constructed and tested and found to work satisfactory. The developed system can be used for any security purposes. Example: Bank Vault Security (to secure the bank vault room), Museum (where a lot of ancient and precious things are preserved), Offices (where unauthorized entry is prohibited) and so on. Finally our security system can be more upgradable with some modification.
